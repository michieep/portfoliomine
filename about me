    Hello! My name is Michelle Phillips. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at MGKVP University, India, where I am in my 5th semester. Coming from a science background, I enjoy exploring technology and how it can solve real-world problems.

Along with academics, I am passionate about designing, creativity, and learning new digital skills. I have experience working with tools like Canva and enjoy creating designs for events, invitations, and presentations.

I believe in growing not just professionally but also spiritually and personally. My journey is about balancing education, creativity, and faith, while constantly striving to improve and learn more each day.
